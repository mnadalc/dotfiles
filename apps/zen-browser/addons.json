All that tracking code is not necessary for a website to be displayed or work correctly and can therefore be removed—that is exactly what ClearURLs does.\n\nAnother common example are Amazon URLs. If you search for a product on Amazon you will see a very long URL, such as: https://www.amazon.com/dp/exampleProduct/ref=sxin_0_pb?__mk_de_DE=ÅMÅŽÕÑ&keywords=tea&pd_rd_i=exampleProduct&pd_rd_r=8d39e4cd-1e4f-43db-b6e7-72e969a84aa5&pd_rd_w=1pcKM&pd_rd_wg=hYrNl&pf_rd_p=50bbfd25-5ef7-41a2-68d6-74d854b30e30&pf_rd_r=0GMWD0YYKA7XFGX55ADP&qid=1517757263&rnid=2914120011\n\nIndeed most of the above URL is tracking code. Once ClearURLs has cleaned the address, it will look like this:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/exampleProduct\n\nWhy use this extension as opposed to similar ones?\nMost other “link cleaners” employ about a dozen rules when looking for tracking parameters to remove. ClearURLs utilizes over 250 rules, so its capabilities are more comprehensive.\nAnd ClearURLs is open source, so everyone can join in to the project and/or can check the source code to error or malicious code.\n\nAll functions in a nutshell\n\n    Removes tracking from URLs automatically in the background\n    Blocks some common ad domains (optional)\n    Has a built-in tool to clean up multiple URLs at once\n    Supports redirection to the destination, without tracking services as middleman\n    Adds an entry to the context menu so that links can be copied quickly and cleanly\n    Blocks hyperlink auditing, also known as ping tracking\n    Prevents tracking injection over history API\n    Prevents Google from rewriting the search results (to include tracking elements)\n    Prevents Yandex from rewriting the search results (to include tracking elements)\n\n\nWhat do we collect?\nThis extension protects and respects your privacy.

Ads that streamer embeds directly into the stream will be shown.\n\n• “Audio only” mode. Ideal for music listening.\n\n• The extension automatically opens chests with bonus points in chat.\n\n• You can set the size and location of the chat, even while in full-screen mode.\n\n• In chat (for example, attached to the bottom or top side of the window) there is room for much more messages and emotes.\n\n• You can completely disable the chat: it will not consume computer resources, and you will not be in the chatters list.\n\n• Changes volume by mouse wheel.\n\n• You can colorize the player interface to your liking.\n\n• Takes up less RAM.\n\n• Rapid start-up of the player. This is especially noticeable on slower computers.\n\n• Allows you to disable stretching the small video to the player size.\n\n• Allows you to continue viewing the broadcast in another player, for example Media Player Classic, VLC Media Player, or MX Player.\n\n• Large number of useful (and not so) settings.\n\nThe extension requires your permission to access several domains where Twitch stores its video. The list of domains may expand over time.\n\nThe player can playback only live broadcasts and does not affect playback of videos.\n\nI do not recommend using the extension without a mouse, because touch screen support is incomplete.\n\nYou should not block the JavaScript on the website Twitch.tv, for example in the NoScript extension. Also you should not block the loading of HTML5 video, for example in the Flashblock extension.\n\nExtension is tested only in the Firefox browser. Operability of extension in other browsers based on the same engine, for example Tor Browser and Pale Moon, is not guaranteed.\n\nIf you have problems with the extension, first read the help. To do this, in the player right click the view area, then in the menu click “Help”. If you still have questions, then in the same menu click \"Send Feedback\". If you cannot start the player, send an e-mail to the extension developer. The e-mail address is located somewhere on this page.\n\nThis extension is not an official Twitch application. The extension was created by independent developer, who is not affiliated with Twitch Interactive, Inc company in any way. The extension inserts part of the Twitch.tv website — chat — into extension player.\n\nThe extension is also available for Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge browsers.","weeklyDownloads":2107,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Alexander Choporov (CoolCmd)","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/6117595/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/206/206888.png?modified=1622132423","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/206/206888.jpg?modified=1622132423","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333,"caption":"Instant replay"}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.2926,"reviewCount":466,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/twitch_5/reviews/","updateDate":1720349397000},{"id":"arc-dark-theme@afnankhan","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/static-server/img/addon-icons/default-32.2b26add4b394.png","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/static-server/img/addon-icons/default-64.d144b50f2bb8.png","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/static-server/img/addon-icons/default-128.452018499894.png"},"name":"Arc Dark Theme","version":"2021.6.2","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3786185/arc_dark_theme_we-2021.6.2.xpi","homepageURL":null,"supportURL":null,"amoListingURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/arc-dark-theme-we/","description":"Arc Dark theme for Firefox","fullDescription":null,"weeklyDownloads":579,"type":"theme","creator":{"name":"Afnan Khan","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/5641275/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/version-previews/full/2918/2918406.png?modified=1622821433","width":680,"height":92,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/version-previews/thumbs/2918/2918406.png?modified=1622821433","thumbnailWidth":473,"thumbnailHeight":64},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/version-previews/full/2918/2918408.svg?modified=1622821434","width":720,"height":92,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/version-previews/thumbs/2918/2918408.jpg?modified=1622821434","thumbnailWidth":720,"thumbnailHeight":92}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.796,"reviewCount":129,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/arc-dark-theme-we/reviews/","updateDate":1622635824000},{"id":"admin@2fas.com","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2756/2756539-32.png?modified=eeea864f","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2756/2756539-64.png?modified=eeea864f","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2756/2756539-128.png?modified=eeea864f"},"name":"2FAS - Two factor authentication","version":"1.7.3","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4373796/2fas_two_factor_authentication-1.7.3.xpi","homepageURL":"https://2fas.com/","supportURL":"https://2fas.com/","amoListingURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2fas-two-factor-authentication/","description":"2FAS extension is simple, private, and secured: one click, one tap, and your 2FA token is automatically entered!","fullDescription":"Add 2FAS to your web browser with our extension!
